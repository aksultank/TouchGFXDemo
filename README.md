# TouchGFXDemo
I'm trying to run TouchGFX on Nucleo-F412ZG+SPI LCD(https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B072N551V3).
I already are a success to run SPI LCD function and SPI TC function independently.

For SPI LCD is as;
- SPILCDTest
- SPILCDTestFPS
- SPILCDTestXY

For SPI TC is as;
- TouchTest
- TouchTestHW

# Trying
I'm developing as;
- GUITestNoOS

It's not working now.
